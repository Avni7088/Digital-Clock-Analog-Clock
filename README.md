# Digital Clock and Analog Clock

This repository contains implementations of a digital clock and an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Digital Clock

The digital clock is implemented using JavaScript's `Date` object to fetch the current time and display it in a digital format.

## Analog Clock

The analog clock is created using HTML for the clock face and CSS for styling. JavaScript is used to calculate the current time and rotate the clock hands accordingly.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Avni7088/Digital-Clock-Analog-Clock.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You will see both the digital and analog clocks displayed on the page.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to enhance the clocks or integrate them into your projects.
